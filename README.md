### **Block Blast Clone - Pygame Tutorial**

This is a simple **Block Blast** clone made with **Python** and **Pygame**. The project is built to help me learn game development and understand the basics of game mechanics, including grid-based puzzle gameplay, shape manipulation, and collision detection.

### **Features**
- **Grid-based gameplay**: A 10x10 grid where blocks are placed and cleared.
- **Drag-and-drop mechanics**: Players can drag shapes and place them on the grid.
- **Shape variety**: Includes basic shapes like a square, line, and L-shape.
- **Row clearing**: Rows are cleared when fully filled with blocks, and the score increases.
- **Basic scoring system**: The score increases as rows are cleared.

### **To-Do**
- Add more shapes.
- Implement shape rotation.
- Improve drag-and-drop functionality (snap-to-grid).
- Implement a game-over condition.
- Create a polished user interface and improve game visuals.
